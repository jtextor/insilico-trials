\arguments{
\item{RHO}{Tumor proliferation rate}

\item{RAISE_KILLING}{The multiplication factor to increase the killing rate 
of cytotoxic T cells as a treatment effect of immune therapy. The default 
value 1 indicates no treatment effect. To simulate the immune therapy effect
the value should be greater than 1.}

\item{LOWER_GROWTH}{The multiplication factor to reduce 
the tumor growth as a treatment effect of chemotherapy. The default 
value 1 indicates no treatment effect. To simulate the chemotherapy effect
the value should be lower than 1.}

\item{DIAGNOSIS_THRESHOLD}{The number of tumor cell at which cancer is diagnosed}

\item{DEATH_THRESHOLD}{The lethal number of tumor cell}

\item{TREATMENT_DELAY}{The delay between the diagnosis and start of 
the immune therapy in months}

\item{TREATMENT_DURATION}{Immune therapy duration in months}

\item{CHEMO_DELAY}{The delay between the diagnosis and start of 
the chemotherapy in months}

\item{CHEMO_DURATION}{Chemotherapy duration in months}

\item{T_MAX}{The maximum treatment duration in months}
}
\value{
For the get_survival_cpp_MX functions, the
   survival of a patient in months. For the simulate_MX functions, a
   matrix representing the disease trajectory (see examples). 
   Caution: for the simulate_MX functions the 
output time resolution is _days_, not months.
}
\description{
The functions get_survival_cpp_MX calculate survival of a simulated patient in months
with model MX (X=1,2, or 3), whereas the functions simulate_MX 
generate simulated disease trajectories (i.e., patients over time) 
for a single patient with different models. 
See Creemers et al. (2023) for full definitions of each model.

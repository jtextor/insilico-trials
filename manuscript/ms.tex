\section*{Abstract}


Late-stage cancer immunotherapy trials often lead to unusual survival curve shapes, like delayed curve separation or a plateauing curve in the treatment arm. It is critical for trial success to anticipate such effects in advance and adjust the design accordingly. Here, we use \emph{in silico} cancer immunotherapy trials – simulated trials based on three different mathematical models – to assemble virtual patient cohorts undergoing late-stage immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or combination therapies. We find that all three simulation models predict the distinctive survival curve shapes commonly associated with immunotherapies. Considering four aspects of clinical trial design – sample size, endpoint, randomization rate, and interim analyses – we demonstrate how, by simulating various possible scenarios, the robustness of trial design choices can be scrutinized, and possible pitfalls can be identified in advance. We provide readily usable, web-based implementations of our three trial simulation models to facilitate their use by biomedical researchers, doctors, and trialists.

\section*{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

 Immunotherapy is revolutionizing the treatment landscape for patients with advanced
cancers. While the number of immuno-oncology drugs under investigation is rising rapidly -- around
4700 agents are currently in the development pipeline -- the need to further improve patient outcomes
remains high\cite{Upadhaya2020}. Well-designed immunotherapy trials are crucial to establish advances in clinical
outcomes robustly. Unfortunately, the odds for cancer treatments to successfully pass the
development pipeline are unfavorable, and only a minority of the treatments (5-10\%) ultimately
obtain market approval \cite{Dowden2019, Wong2018, BIO2021}. Even for cancer therapies that do 
reach late-stage development, approval rates remain modest at around 27\%\cite{Hwang2016}. 
The primary reason in most of these trials (i.e., 63.7\%) is failure 
to demonstrate efficacy \cite{Hwang2016}, 
which can be partly attributed to suboptimal trial design choices based on
overly optimistic assumptions of the treatment effect. Such assumptions may be used to erroneously
justify low numbers of patients or inappropriate endpoints and lower the power of 
these trials \cite{Hwang2016, deMiguel2020}. 

Immunotherapy trials raise complex design questions, and conventional design
methods are not always a good match to the unique characteristics of immunotherapies \cite{Li2020}.
There is a very broad spectrum of therapies based on various molecular mechanisms --
ranging from immunomodulators to cell therapies, cancer vaccines, 
oncolytic viruses, and CD3-targeted bispecific antibodies -- 
that can lead to unusual toxicity profiles, response patterns, and survival kinetics
\cite{Cousin2018, Seymour2017, Hoos2010}. 
These observations render a ``one-design-fits-all'' approach futile and stress the need 
for designs that are tailored to immunotherapy or even combination therapies.

Immunotherapies are known to induce a delayed clinical effect and long-term overall survival
 (OS) in only a subset of patients \cite{Chen2013}. The survival curve reflects these phenomena by a
 delayed curve separation and a plateau of the treatment arm at later stages of the trial \cite{Mick2015}. 
 These characteristics violate a fundamental premise that underlies the design of many
 trials: the proportional hazard assumption (PHA) -- essentially stating that the treatment
 effect should remain
 constant over time \cite{Rahman2019}. As a result, immunotherapy trials based on this principle can have an
 overestimated power \cite{Mick2015, Rahman2019} and require a longer follow-up to
demonstrate efficacy than initially planned \cite{Mick2015}, increasing the likelihood of a negative trial.

These issues led to the development of innovative methods such as novel radiological criteria
to quantify tumor responses \cite{Seymour2017, Hodi2018, Wolchok2009}, 
(surrogate) endpoints to capture unique survival kinetics 
\cite{Hoos2010, Anagnostou2017, Mushti2018, Chen2015, Kaufman2017},
biomarkers to enrich for patients more likely to respond to treatment 
\cite{Chan2019, Dudley2016, Patel2015, Sha2020}, 
and statistical methods to retain a trial's power in the presence of unusual survival 
kinetics \cite{Chen2018, Royston2013, Xu2016}. Despite
the multitude of available methods, it is difficult to predict trial outcomes 
in advance and select the methodology accordingly. The stakes are high: a trial design 
built on accurate predictions of the response kinetics is more likely to be positive,
whereas misjudgment could result in a negative trial, potentially compromising patient benefit,
vast amounts of work, and  (public) research funds.

In this study, we use late-stage \emph{in silico} cancer immunotherapy trials to investigate how design
decisions affect the trial outcome in the context of cancer immunotherapy, possibly combined with
chemotherapy. The mechanism-based nature of these trials allows researchers to translate cellular
processes in the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapeutic interventions thereon into predicted
response patterns, survival kinetics, and trial outcomes. An \emph{in silico}
immunotherapy trial is based on explicit biological assumptions and provides an intuitive means to
predict risk profiles and treatment efficacy. Moreover, it equips researchers with a tool to scrutinize trial
designs and analysis strategies of upcoming trials in advance to identify potential risks and pitfalls.

We use three different simulation models to perform our \emph{in silico} trials, based on
work by ourselves \cite{Creemers2021} and other authors \cite{Tsur2020,Bekker2022}.
Despite considerable differences, all models replicate late-stage immunotherapy or combination trials
reasonably well and capture their typical survival kinetics. Then, we demonstrate various applications of
such trial simulations, including the ability to scrutinize a clinical trial's design and sample size
calculations based on a range of predicted possible outcomes. Finally, we illustrate the consequences 
of (not) considering  immunotherapy-specific response patterns in settings selected for educational purposes,
such as  selecting survival endpoints and randomization ratios of upcoming trials and planning
interim analyses.

\subsection*{Generating trial populations based on tumor-immune dynamics}

We used \emph{in silico} cancer immunotherapy trials based on mechanistic simulations
of cancer-immune dynamics to investigate the consequences of
immunotherapy-specific response patterns on trial design principles \cite{Xu2016}.
The virtual patients in these trials are simulated with ODE models, which describe
disease courses based on assumptions about interactions between tumor cells
and the immune system \cite{Xu2016}. 
{\newbit\linelabel{sentfollowup:start}
In this paper, we will focus on simulating 
two years of follow-up after treatment -- while it is straightforward to consider longer follow up
times with \emph{in silico} trials, a two-year time frame is common 
for contemporary immunotherapy trials \cite{Chen2019,Hellmann2019,Baas2021}.
\linelabel{sentfollowup:end}
}

{\newbit\linelabel{par:models:start}
To investigate the extent to which our simulation results depend on specific modeling choices, we use 
three different ODE models. Model 1 (M1) describes the following
tumor-immune dynamics in the tumor microenvironment: immunogenic tumor growth
leading to priming and clonal expansion of na\"ive T cells,
migration of effector T cells to the tumor microenvironment,
and formation of tumor-immune complexes to enable tumor cell killing (see
Methods; \myref{fig:fig1}{A}). We simulate treating these patients with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), chemotherapy, or both. ICI increase the T~cell 
killing rate and directly affect the tumor-immune dynamics. Chemotherapy has a cytotoxic effect on the tumor,
slowing its growth. A detailed description of the model, including
the rationale for parameter selection, has been published previously \cite{Xu2016}.
In contrast, model 2 (M2) does not represent T cells migration
between lymph nodes and tumor microenvironment; however, it does contain an explicit 
representation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) \cite{Tsur2019}. Finally, Model 3 (M3) 
does not contain either T~cell migration or APCs, but it does take T~cell 
exhaustion into account.
Another important difference between the models lies in how tumor growth is represented: 
M1 uses a size-dependent growth rate,
M3 a resource-constrained growth rate (logistic growth), and M2 uses unlimited
exponential growth.\linelabel{par:models:end}}

this tumor grows to a lethal volume (upper horizontal line) over the course of several months.
Treatment is started when the tumor reaches a size of $65 \times 10^8$ cells (lower horizontal line).
Immunotherapy is implemented in each model by increasing the rate at which T~cells kill tumor cells; in M2, the death rate
of T~cells is additionally decreased by the same factor. The treatment effect sizes are chosen per model such that
there is a partial response (orange, leading to prolonged survival) or a complete response 
(red, leading to tumor eradication). The recurrence of the tumor in M3 is a consequence of the model's
equations, which lead to oscillating dynamics of the tumor burden rather than complete eradication in the 
complete response regime. Arrows indicate start of treatment.}
\label{fig:models}
\end{figure}

Regardless of model specifics, \emph{in silico}
clinical trials describe cancer outcomes on three levels: (1) a
cellular level, (2) a patient level, and (3) a trial population level. Cellular
interactions in the tumor microenvironment are translated into clinical trial
outcomes as follows: firstly, the ODE model is implemented, and model parameters
that vary between patients are selected by fitting to existing survival data (\myref{fig:fig1}B; see Methods).
Next, individualized disease trajectories -- either treated or untreated -- of
cancer patients are generated (\myref{fig:fig1}C). Eventually, patients are randomized
into two cohorts to resemble conventional phase III trials: a control group
(either placebo or chemotherapy) and a treatment group (immunotherapy,
chemoimmunotherapy, or induction chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy; \myref{fig:fig1}D). 
Since the cellular dynamics (e.g., tumor burden over time or the efficacy
of T cell killing) and survival outcomes of these patients are known and can be
modified, \emph{in silico} clinical trials are suited to answer questions
like:``Assuming that a novel treatment increases T cell killing 5-fold, how
does this translate to a survival benefit in patients? Moreover, how many
patients are needed to establish this benefit in a clinical trial? When should
one analyze the results?'' (\myref{fig:fig1}E).

Despite their differing mechanisms, the models generate qualitatively
similar predictions (\myref{fig:models}): tumors grow at realistic
speeds and are usually not cleared by the immune system without therapeutic intervention.
In the models, therapeutic interventions can slow or even reverse tumor growth, 
in principle leading  to two major contrasting outcomes: death or long-term survival. 
However, there is a unique effect in M3 where even after treatment and growth 
reverse, the tumor burden keeps oscillating over time, leading to regular self-resolving
recurrences. While this may not be entirely realistic, it is not an issue for our 
purpose as we shall focus on 
the initial growth trajectory of the tumor preceding and up to
2 years after treatment, and recurrences happen after that.

\subsection*{\emph{In silico} late-stage immunotherapy trials yield realistic survival outcomes}

To investigate whether our \emph{in silico} models can generate
realistic survival curves as observed in late-stage immunotherapy trials, we
fitted the models to three different datasets: (1) the NCCTG lung cancer
survival dataset \cite{Loprinzi1994}; (2) the CA184-024 trial (ipilimumab +
dacarbazine vs. dacarbazine in previously untreated metastatic melanoma
\cite{Maio2015}); and (3) the CheckMate 066 trial (nivolumab + placebo vs.
dacarbazine + placebo in treatment-naive metastatic melanoma patients without
BRAF mutation \cite{Ascierto2019}). The choice for these trials is based on the
size of the trials and the maturity of the data. The follow-up of the CA184-024
trial and the CheckMate 066 trial were five and three years, respectively. As
the last two datasets were not publicly available, we extracted the data using
image digitization (see Methods). As a reference for the \emph{in silico}
trials, we visualized the Kaplan-Meier estimators of these datasets
(\myref{fig:fig2}{A}). Both trials were digitized correctly, as reflected by
the nearly identical risk tables compared to the original manuscripts
\cite{Maio2015,Ascierto2019}. 
{\newbit 
\linelabel{parfitexplain:start}
Next, we fitted the tumor growth rate distributions
and treatment effect parameters for chemotherapy and immunotherapy s
(NCCTG: 3 parameters; immunotherapy trials: 4 parameters)
to these datasets (M1: \myref{fig:fig2}{B}; M2, M3: \mysupp{fig:fits_m2_m3}).
For the CA184-024 and CheckMate 066 trials, the simulated patients were
treated with ICI upon diagnosis, increasing their T~cell killing rates.
For simplicity, we did not simulate dropout or censoring in the trials shown in
this paper, although it could be added to the simulation. Model M1 achieved satisfactory
fits to all datasets. However, M2 and M3 had difficulties fitting the CheckMate 066 data, 
with M2 predicting more rapid death in the control arm and M3 predicting a cross-over
of survival curves. M3 also had difficulties fitting the other two datasets, as its
survival curves plateaued from 12 months after treatment onwards.
While the fit of all models can be improved by allowing more parameters
to vary, we chose to keep the number of fitted parameters small
to investigate the consequences of such issues on our downstream analyses.\linelabel{parfitexplain:end}} 

Hence, our \emph{in silico} trials couple the disease mechanism and mechanistic treatment
effect to a predicted clinical trial outcome. By allowing model parameters to vary 
between patients, such models can be fitted to existing clinical trial data. Whether
 a good fit can be achieved depends on the model assumptions and the number of parameters
that are allowed to vary. In our case, models M1 and M2 were able to fit the three
datasets reasonably well, with M3 showing a substantially worse fit.  

Interestingly, although not incorporated explicitly, the models reproduced hallmark survival
curve features arising as a consequence of the
interaction between tumor and immune cells typically seen in immunotherapy
trials: a delayed curve separation and a plateau of the survival curve of the
treatment arm at later stages of the trial 
(last two columns in \myref{fig:fig2}B and \mysupp{fig:fits_m2_m3}).

\subsection*{\emph{In silico} immunotherapy trials predict immunotherapy-specific response patterns}

The design and the success rate of any clinical trial depends, among others, on
a realistic predictions of the shape of the survival curves and the distribution 
of clinical outcomes. For late-stage immunotherapy trials,
commonly observed immunotherapy-induced response patterns are a delayed curve
separation and a plateauing tail of the survival curve of the treatment arm
(\myref{fig:fig2}). These characteristic survival curve shapes violate a
vital premise of many clinical trials: the proportional hazard
assumption (PHA). The PHA states that the ``instantaneous death rate'' of a
patient (i.e., the hazard rate) in both arms of the trial should be
proportional, resulting in a constant hazard ratio. Many traditional design
methods, ranging from sample size calculations to outcome analyses, are based on
this convenient assumption. For late-stage immunotherapy trials, this induces
two problems: (1) while a violation of the PHA needs to be addressed during
trial planning, the hazard rates -- and an eventual violation of the PHA -- becomes
available only after the trial; and (2) if a trial does not 
adhere to a PHA, what will be the shape of the survival curve? Especially in
an era where treatment and control arm regimens are becoming increasingly
complex, adjusting the design and analysis methods to various survival curve shapes
is challenging.

\emph{In silico} clinical trials can provide principled predictions about possible
shapes of the survival curve, including the underlying hazard rates and hazard ratios, before
trial execution. 
{\newbit \linelabel{sentfitca:start}
We generated such survival predictions using the models -- fitted 
to the CA184-024 data (\mytab{tab:parfits}) -- 
and changed the treatment effect parameters according to the simulated scenario.
\linelabel{sentfitca:end}}
A traditional scenario would be a trial in which
patients are randomized 1:1 to mono-chemotherapy or placebo. Given the direct
chemotherapy effect, the PHA is generally assumed to hold for these trials. An
\emph{in silico} trial in which chemotherapy reduces the tumor growth rate 
for the entire trial duration indeed replicates these assumptions
(\mysupp{fig:chemotherapy_prophaz}): the survival curves separate from the start of the
trial, and the hazard ratio remains roughly constant over time. However, what happens if the
chemotherapy effect does not last for the entire trial but for -- maybe more
realistically -- 6 months? For M1 and M2, the initial proportional separation of the survival
curves is followed by a parallel decay and eventual convergence of both curves, leading to an
early but transient survival benefit for the chemotherapy arm (\myref{fig:fig3}{A, B}). 
For M3, the chemotherapy effect estimated from the CA184-024 data is more profound
and instead induces a permanent response (\myref{fig:fig3}{C}).
Hence, substantial deviations from the PHA are observed in all cases, even for seemingly
simple chemotherapy trials.  
Also, a violated PHA becomes immediately apparent when considering a more contemporary
scenario of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy
compared to chemotherapy alone: through approximately the first
six months, the hazard rates remain constant over time, but after that, they
start to decline in the immunotherapy group (cyan line), yielding a non-constant
hazard ratio over time (\myref{fig:fig3}{D}).

The flexibility of \emph{in silico} trials lies in their ability to incorporate
complex treatment regimens. For example, let us assume one would be interested
in estimating the survival curves and underlying hazard ratio over time of 
an immunotherapy + placebo-chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy + placebo-immunotherapy
trial (\myref{fig:fig3}{E}) or a trial with induction chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy vs.
immunotherapy (\myref{fig:fig3}{F}). Mechanism-based immunotherapy trials 
translate biological assumptions regarding the disease and treatment
effects into survival curves (including its hazard rate/ratio estimates).
The resulting survival curve shapes, such as crossing survival curves (\myref{fig:fig3}{E}) or a
temporary curve separation (\myref{fig:fig3}{F}), may be hard to predict otherwise and
can be detrimental to the trial outcome if addressed appropriately. 

{\newbit \linelabel{sentmodeldiff:start} We emphasize that different models can generate different predictions depending 
on model assumptions and parameters, as seen in our chemotherapy vs. placebo examples
(\myref{fig:fig3}{A, B, C}). Conversely, however, even substantially different models
can agree on the essential aspects of the predicted survival curves. For example, despite
 their differences, our three models all predict the characteristic delayed curve separation
of immunotherapy trials (\myref{fig:fig3}{D}, \mysupp{fig:pred_m2}, \mysupp{fig:pred_m3}).

\subsection*{Using \emph{in silico} trials to select an appropriate outcome metric for measuring a treatment's clinical effect}

A key design decision in a clinical trial is which effect size metric to use to define treatment success. 
Two common choices are the overall hazard ratio, which is affected by the entire survival data of the trial,
and a survival endpoint such as 2-year overall survival (OS), which only depends on the specifically defined time-point.
When there is no solid clinical rationale to prefer one effect size measure over the other, 
statistical considerations such as power become important. To investigate the consequences of choosing
hazard ratio or 2-year OS as the study effect size in different immunotherapy scenarios, we determined
the power of \emph{in silico} trials by conducting simulations at varying study population sizes.

\linelabel{parpoweranalysishazard:start}
A potential advantage of using the hazard ratio is its use of the entire survival curve, which can 
increase power when the PHA is met and detect transient effects even if the PHA is not met. 
\linelabel{parpoweranalysishazard:end}
Indeed,
when investigating the power of the transient chemotherapy effect generated by model M1 
(\myref{fig:fig3}{A}), we found the power to be much greater when using the hazard ratio compared to the 
power to detect the minimal difference in survival still found after 2 years. The opposite was
true when investigating the chemoimmunotherapy vs. immunotherapy scenario using M2 (\myref{fig:fig3}{B}):
the power of trials that used the hazard ratio lagged far behind the power to detect a 2-year survival endpoint,
as a consequence of the considerable violation of the PHA in this scenario. Indeed, when considering the 
persistent chemotherapy effect generated by model M3 (\myref{fig:fig3}{C}), a scenario with a substantially
lower variation of the hazard ratio, we found the power to be more comparable, although the hazard ratio 
still had a meaningful advantage. When using M3 to investigate the chemoimmunotherapy vs. immunotherapy scenario,
the choice of endpoint made hardly any difference (\mysupp{fig:pwr_m2_m3}).

\linelabel{parpoweranalysisagreement:start}
These results illustrate the critical importance of choosing an appropriate effect size to measure the 
clinical outcome, which in turn strongly depends on the shape of the survival curves. For established
treatments, investigators can rely on their experience or published results to make an appropriate choice;
however, the expected survival curve shape might be very uncertain for novel immunotherapies or combinations of existing immunotherapies. 
In such cases, running various \emph{in silico} trials would help investigators prepare for different plausible scenarios and choose a robust trial design. In our examples, the models agreed that 
hazard ratio would be a suitable effect size for a chemotherapy vs. placebo trial even if the PHA does
not entirely hold, whereas 2-year OS would be appropriate for the chemoimmunotherapy vs. immunotherapy case
(\mysupp{fig:pwr_m2_m3}).

\end{figure}


\subsection*{\emph{In silico} trials can help to choose endpoints and randomization ratios before trial execution}

Clearly, the success rate of novel immunotherapy trials depends on more than
its sample size alone. To establish an OS benefit of the treatment arm, it is
crucial to analyze the trial once the data have reached a certain maturity --
i.e., the treatment needs to be granted sufficient time to induce a survival
benefit. We assumed that a delayed curve separation in immunotherapy trials
would prolong the follow-up needed to establish an OS benefit of immunotherapy
and thereby defer reaching maturity of the trial data. If the therapy is
effective, data maturity can be regarded as the time point when a treatment
effect can be observed. Hence, an optimal trial endpoint would be the earliest
time at which this treatment effect can be detected with sufficient power.
Therefore, we analyzed the power of differently sized trials with respect to
their OS endpoint. Herein, we distinguished trials that were subject or were
not subject to a delayed curve separation (immunotherapy and chemotherapy,
respectively). In a classic chemotherapy trial, the treatment effect translates
directly to a survival benefit in the treatment arm -- the survival curves
separate from the start. Therefore, the highest power is obtained after
the total duration of the treatment effect (\myref{fig:fig5}{A}, panel 1). In this case,
the treatment effect lasts for six months, leading to the 6-months OS as the
endpoint with the highest power. The delayed curve separation in immunotherapy
trials renders it futile to analyze OS data early on in the trial (\myref{fig:fig5}{B},
panel 1). A practical ramification is that in the presence of a delayed curve
separation, the trial requires a sufficiently long follow-up and an adequate
size to gain power and detect immunotherapy-specific treatment effects.
Mechanism- and simulation-based power calculations with \emph{in silico} trials can
consider these specific survival curve features when determining the sample size for upcoming
trials. 

Given the observation that both the size of an immunotherapy trial and its
endpoint heavily influence the probability of finding the survival benefit of
interest, we presumed that increasing the size of the treatment arm -- i.e., an
unequal randomization scheme -- would similarly affect the power. Instead of
varying the study size, we now varied the randomization ratio (second panel of
\myref{fig:fig5}{A/B}). Interestingly, while the power logically depended on the OS
endpoint, the randomization ratio did not greatly affect the power (\myref{fig:fig5}{B}).
Considering that an unequal treatment allocation may provide ethical benefits,
we confirm that the randomization ratio in immunotherapy trials is of secondary
importance compared to its size or primary OS endpoint. 

In summary, our \emph{in silico} immunotherapy trials replicate existing insights from trial design 
as to how violation of the PHA affects power and analysis choices. Our ability to
directly translate biological assumptions on treatment mechanisms into survival
curve shapes allows the trialist to reason deliberately about whether
such violations of the PHA would or would not be expected in their specific
trial design and how the problem could be addressed if it arises.

\subsection*{Simulating interim analyses to evaluate the trade-off between patient benefit and trial resources}
We have observed a clear trade-off between the power of an immunotherapy trial
on the one hand, and the primary OS endpoint, and correspondingly the data
maturity, on the other. Luckily, the two are not entirely mutually exclusive:
interim analyses have been developed for ethical purposes to establish positive
or harmful treatment effects early. However, there is a catch: the necessity to
control for multiple testing at each interim analysis lowers the significance
threshold on the final analysis to maintain the same overall type I error rate.
This raises the question: ``How many interim analyses should you plan, and when
should you plan them?'' Again, well-founded answers to such questions can be
obtained with the help of \emph{in silico} immunotherapy trials. To illustrate this,
we used M1 to simulate 1000 immunotherapy trials with 1200 patients per trial, randomized
1:1 over immunotherapy with a strong treatment effect or a placebo (\myref{fig:fig6}{A}).
In the absence of interim analyses, the vast majority of the trials are
predicted to end up positive. Adding interim analyses (O'Brien-Fleming
approach) to the equation induces a trade-off. On the one hand, increasing the
number of equally-spaced interim analyses increases the probability of early
detecting a positive treatment effect (e.g., approximately 60\% of the trials
are positive after 18 months in the case of three interim analyses; \myref{fig:fig6}{A}).
On the other hand, the overall probability of ending up with a negative trial
due to more stringent analyses (i.e., less power) also increases, especially in
the case of immunotherapies with a weaker treatment effect ($\pm$57\% without
an interim analysis vs. $\pm$63\% with three interim analyses; \myref{fig:fig6}{B}). In
an actual trial, the latter needs to be corrected by including additional
patients to maintain the pre-planned power. Furthermore, we observe that the
timing of the interim analysis is crucial. Whereas an interim analysis at 18
months provides additional value to the trial, interim analyses before 16
months are predicted to be wasteful due to
non-proportional hazards and less mature data. As a control, we simulated
trials without any treatment effect. By design, approximately 95\% of the
trials should end up negative irrespective of the number of interim analyses,
which indeed seemed to be the case (\myref{fig:fig6}{C}). 
Logically, the weaker the treatment
effect, the higher the probability of erroneously finding a harmful treatment
effect -- a characteristic that the simulation also exhibits (\myref{fig:fig6}{B/C}).

\section*{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

{\newbit\linelabel{par:modeldiscuss:start}
Over the past decade, tumor-immune dynamics have been investigated extensively with 
\emph{in silico} models. In the early days of cancer immunotherapy, these modeling
efforts focused -- next to chemotherapy \cite{Agur2010} -- on cellular immunotherapy
\cite{Gupta2015,Walker2016}. More recently, the field has addressed ICI therapy 
(e.g., \cite{Tsur2019,Butner2020,Coletti2021}). 
Models of tumor-immune dynamics have been applied to study 
pharmacokinetic and therapy dynamics (PK/PD), treatment effects
(including mechanism(s) of action, optimizing dosing regimens), treatment combinations, 
toxicity, biomarker prediction, drug resistance, and drug discovery (see reviews on 
these topics~\cite{Gupta2015,Konstorum2017,Brown2018,Yates2020,Agur2016,dePillis2014,Craig2020}).
These extensive modeling efforts by the Mathematical Oncology community have created a rich and 
valuable methodological resource. The goal of the work described in this paper is to 
tap into this resource for the purpose of clinical trial design. Once parameterized, a
mathematical model can predict likely outcomes of treatments for individual patients;
using such a model for trial design requires considering heterogeneity between patients 
and translating these into likely survival curve shapes for each arm of the trial.
\linelabel{par:modeldiscuss:end}
}

In this study, we leveraged mathematical models to perform cancer immunotherapy trials
\emph{in silico}, predicting survival and response profiles of various treatment regimens.
Complementary to conventional design methods, \emph{in silico} trials provide the
ability to investigate the implications of a researcher's biological (as
opposed to statistical) hypotheses about a drug's mechanism of action for the
design, conduct, analysis, and outcome of clinical trials. When comparing the
simulated outcomes to actual immunotherapy trial outcomes, we showed that 
\emph{in silico} trials are suited to translate complex biological mechanisms (such as those
observed during the treatment of patients with ICI) into realistic trial
outcomes. Crucially, regardless of the model, 
the survival curves from these
mechanism-based simulations reflected two pivotal components often found in
immunotherapy trials: a delayed curve separation and a plateauing tail of the
survival curve at later stages of the trial. In line with genuine immunotherapy
trials, we find that these immunotherapy-specific response patterns differ
considerably from chemotherapy. Our findings confirm that
diversity in survival curves profoundly impacts the outcomes of immunotherapy
trials \cite{Chen2016}. Consequently, these features need to be considered when
deciding on the sample size, endpoint, randomization ratio, and the number and
timing of interim analyses of a novel cancer immunotherapy trial.

\emph{In silico} clinical trials are gaining popularity in medicine.
Such trials enable investigating, among others, how novel drugs, treatment
schedules, dosing regimens, and inter-patient heterogeneity affect the outcome
of a clinical trial \cite{Alfonso2020}. \emph{In silico} clinical studies have a wide
range of applicability from pediatric infectious \cite{Valitalo2015} and orphan diseases
\cite{Carlier2018} to diabetes \cite{Klinke2007}, inflammatory autoimmune
diseases \cite{Schmidt2013}, traumatic injury \cite{Brown2015}, psychiatric
illness \cite{Magnusson2017}, and cancer. In oncology, several \emph{in silico}
clinical trials involving chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been
performed \cite{PrezGarca2019}, \cite{Fassoni2018}. Moreover, with the onset of
checkpoint inhibitors, \emph{in silico} immunotherapy trials have gained interest,
leading to trials with anti-CTLA-4-antibodies and anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies
\cite{Jafarnejad2019}, \cite{Milberg2019}, \cite{Wang2019}. The common
denominator in these trials is that they primarily center on
dosing regimens and treatment schedules. Herein lies the main difference with
our simulation approach: although the `key ingredients' of these approaches are
similar -- they are based on a mathematical abstraction of a disease mechanism --
our trials do not aim to optimize treatment schedules. Instead, we complement
traditional design methodology by adding the means to predict key aspects of 
response and survival \emph{a priori} to steer design decisions of novel
immunotherapy trials. These trials differ from traditional trial design
research in that these, often statistically-grounded, approaches simulate
clinical trials based on population-level assumptions (e.g., with particular
distributions of survival times, study durations, or with a specific censoring
mechanism). Examples of such high-level simulation approaches include, but are
certainly not limited to, studies aiming to calculate the sample size and power
of clinical trials \cite{Bang2005}, \cite{Doostfatemeh2016}, \cite{Wilson2020}.
Since these methods lack a direct link to the underlying biological disease
mechanism, interpreting their parameters for individual trial participants is
difficult or even impossible. In contrast, \emph{in silico} trials are founded on
biological assumptions but then translate these assumptions into statistical
concepts such as hazard ratios. In this manner, simulated trials
encourage an interdisciplinary discussion about the design of an upcoming
trial.

\emph{In silico} clinical trials are applicable in several settings. First, they
provide the means to verify clinical trial and treatment assumptions before
investing extensive amounts of work and funds into the development and
execution of a clinical trial and can, thereby, function as a proof of
principle of the soundness of the hypotheses for an upcoming trial.
Scrutinizing each aspect of the trial design might lead to better design decisions and
 reduce unanticipated outcomes. Moreover, this mechanism-based approach
does not necessitate a deep understanding of complex mathematical theorems;
instead, it requires a biological understanding of a disease. This mechanistic
basis is intuitive, which benefits the communication between clinical doctors
and biomedical researchers on the one hand and statisticians and clinical
trialists on the other. Additionally, \emph{in silico} trials might serve as excellent
educational tools. The ability to simulate a wide range -- from basic to highly
advanced -- research questions can be exploited in teaching activities for
entry-level clinicians to experienced trialists. A final implication, which
holds for any trial simulation, is that they may provide some degree of 
insight when conventional clinical trials are unfeasible due to practical or ethical
constraints (e.g., clinical trials in rare diseases, pediatrics, or critical
care medicine).

Nonetheless, \emph{in silico} clinical trials have to be considered in light of some
limitations. The most critical limitation is universal to any scientific model,
whether \emph{in vitro}, \emph{in vivo}, or computational: the immunotherapy trial
outcomes depend heavily (if not entirely) on the biological assumptions of the
model, meaning that incorrect interactions or erroneous parametrization of the
model can lead to inaccurate predictions. The parameterization, in particular,
might pose a problem: given the often novel treatment mechanisms, data to
fine-tune the parameters of the model accurately might be scarce. In these
cases, the simulation itself can be used as a sensitivity analysis to assess to
what extent a certain parameter range, or the structure of the model itself, 
influences the robustness of the predictions. Our use of three different models
in this paper can be seen as such a type of sensitivity analysis; indeed, despite
the major differences, it was reassuring to observe that the models often agreed
when it came to the critical qualitative aspects of the predicted survival curves.

In addition, while ODE models can be rather simple and intuitive to understand,
translating biological principles into an ODE model and implementing it into a
simulation requires thorough knowledge of computational methods, potentially
limiting its widespread applicability. To address these limitations, we have 
made our model implementations available as (1) an interactive website that can
be used without installing any software and without any programming knowledge
(\url{https://computational-immunology.org/models/immunotherapy-trials/});
(2) an R package allowing to run simulations without requiring knowledge of ODEs
and their solutions.

In summary, \emph{in silico} cancer immunotherapy trials offer a versatile approach to
simulate immunotherapy trials based on biological assumptions. As
a simulation tool, they facilitate the scrutiny of trial design decisions
to optimize the probability of a successful immunotherapy trial and contribute
to high-quality research for cancer patients.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Mechanism-based models of the tumor microenvironment}

\linelabel{methodsmodels:start}
We implemented three ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of tumor-immune interactions:
one from our previous work \cite{Creemers2021} and two by other authors \cite{Tsur2020,Bekker2022}. 
We first describe the common aspects of the models, then explain the differences and show the 
model equations. All models describe cancer onset and progression, and we initialize each model by
seeding a single growing tumor cell. This tumor cell divides, leading to a
proliferating mass of tumor cells. The parameter $\rho$ controls the grows rate.
Within the tumor microenvironment, an anti-tumor immune response induces cytotoxic T~cells to kill tumor cells at rate $\xi$.
Intratumoral T~cells die at a rate $\delta$. 
\linelabel{senttumorscale:start}
In these models, the rate at which T~cells are activated and/or proliferate depends initially on the tumor size: 
an early stage microscopic tumor presents fewer antigens than a larger -- but still small -- tumor.
However, antigen presentation saturates as the tumor grows further (scaling factor $T/(g+T)$ in
Equations~\ref{eqn:m1e3},\ref{eqn:m1e4},\ref{eqn:m1e3},\ref{eqn:m3e2}). \linelabel{senttumorscale:end} 
Thus, four model
parameters are shared between the models. Depending on the 
parameter values, it is possible that the immune response eliminates the tumor or that the tumor escapes and 
grows in an uncontrolled fashion.

We now discuss the model equations and parameters. In all models, we denote the number of tumor cells by $T$ 
(Equations~\ref{eqn:m1e1},\ref{eqn:m2e1},\ref{eqn:m3e1}) and the number
of intratumoral T~cells by $I$ (Equations~\ref{eqn:m1e2},\ref{eqn:m2e2},\ref{eqn:m3e2}). Compared to their 
original versions, variables and parameters in the equations below have been renamed, and the 
units of some parameters 
scaled to make the models easily comparable.

{\bfseries Model M1} is based on our previous work \cite{Creemers2021} and has the following equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dT}{dt} & = & \rho T^\frac{3}{4} -  \xi I \frac{ T }{ 1 + \frac{I}{h_I} + \frac{T}{h_T} } \label{eqn:m1e1} \\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = & m_S S - \delta I \label{eqn:m1e2} \\
\frac{dS}{dt} & = & \left( \frac{T}{g+T} \right)(  \alpha_N N  + p_S S ) - m_S S \label{eqn:m1e3} \\
\frac{dN}{dt} & = & - \left( \frac{T}{g+T} \right) \alpha_N N  \label{eqn:m1e4}
\end{eqnarray}
We implemented a tumor growth rate
that is slower than exponential growth. This is a common modeling choice based on data and the biological 
premise that a growing tumor needs to sustain itself with nutrients. A common method to implement 
a sub-exponential growth, which we adopt here, is to raise the number of tumor cells to the 3/4th power to obtain
the number of actively dividing cells \cite{West2001}. We had previously modeled slightly faster-growing tumors 
using the less common power 4/5th \cite{Creemers2021}. However, given that the other two models
already implement faster-growing tumors, we here use the more common, slower one. The killing of tumor
cells is implemented using a double saturation model \cite{Borghans1996}
parameterized as proposed by Gadhamsetty et al.~\cite{Gadhamsetty2014} (Michaelis constants $h_T$ and $h_I$).
The double saturation model reflects 
that T~cell killing of tumor cells takes hours~\cite{Weigelin2021}. The immune cells within the 
tumor microenvironment originate from tumor-draining lymph nodes, where naive cytotoxic T cells ($N$, Equation~\ref{eqn:m1e4})
turn into activated T~cells ($S$, activation rate $\alpha_N$; Equation~\ref{eqn:m1e4}).  
Activated T cells proliferate at rate $p_S$ and migrate to the tumor microenvironment to become
infiltrating T~cells ($I$). 
{\linelabel{parparametermigration:start}
The migration step leads to a slight delay between T~cell activation
and tumor cell killing on the order of days ($m_S=1 \textrm{day}^{-1}$).
If desired, the distinction between lymph node and tumor microenvironment sites could be removed 
for simplicity, given that the migration takes place on a faster timescale than the immune response.
\linelabel{parparametermigration:end}
}

\linelabel{par:m2:start} {\bfseries Model M2}, proposed by  Tsur \emph{et al.}~\cite{Tsur2020}, conceptually differs from M1 in five aspects.
First, its tumor growth is unrestricted exponential. Second, the anti-tumor response saturates with increasing numbers
of tumor cells but not with increasing numbers of T~cells. Third, it explicitly represents antigen-presenting cells,
called $A$ (Equation~\ref{eqn:m2e3}), which are recruited at rate $\alpha_A$ in response to the tumor growth. 
Fourth, its T~cells do not proliferate but are produced at a capped rate. 
Fifth, it does not distinguish between T~cells in the lymph node and intratumoral T~cells. As mentioned above, this is likely not critical.
The model equations are as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dT}{dt} & = & \rho T - \xi I \frac{ T }{1+\frac{T}{h_T}} \label{eqn:m2e1} \\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = & \alpha_e A - \delta I  \label{eqn:m2e2}  \\
\frac{dA}{dt} & = & \alpha_A \frac{T}{g+T} - \delta_A A \label{eqn:m2e3}
\end{eqnarray}\linelabel{par:m2:end} 

\linelabel{par:m3:start} {\bfseries Model M3} was recently proposed by Bekker \emph{et al.}~\cite{Bekker2022}. It has two equations 
representing tumor cells and T~cells. It resembles M2 in that tumor growth is initially exponential, but there is a maximum capacity for tumor cells (logistic growth). Killing dynamics follow a ``mass-action law'' (i.e., there is no saturation of the killing rate like in M1 and~M2). Further, it includes a term for tumor size-dependent T~cell exhaustion. This modeling choice leads to oscillating numbers of T~cells and tumor cells in many parameter regimes. The model equations are as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dT}{dt} & = & \rho T (1 - T/\beta) - \xi I T  \label{eqn:m3e1}  \\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = & \alpha_A + p_I I \frac{T}{g+T} - \delta I - \epsilon IT  \label{eqn:m3e2} 
\end{eqnarray} \linelabel{par:m3:end}

We emphasize that M3 has been presented by Bekker \emph{et al.}~\cite{Bekker2022} as an abstraction of the general mechanisms underlying immunotherapy similar to M1; neither model claims to fit specific time-resolved data. Nevertheless, we included it as we were interested in the impact of the different modeling choices.

\subsection*{Model parameters}

{\newbit
\linelabel{parparameters:start}
\mytab{tab:whichpars}
shows an overview of the parameters in the three models. Four parameters appear in every model, but note that this does not necessarily mean that the parameters can be interpreted in the same way. For example, in a model where killing saturates in a scenario where there are many more tumor cells than T~cells (M1 and~M2), the same value of the killing rate will lead to less effective killing than in a model where there is no such saturation (M3). Other parameters are model-specific. To improve the inter-model comparability and reduce the potential for over-fitting, we left the parameters in all models fixed except the tumor growth rate $\rho$, which we varied to obtain heterogeneous patient populations.

Parameter values for M1 and M2 were taken from earlier publications~\cite{Creemers2021,Tsur2020}, where the biological reasoning underlying these values is explained, and references are provided. Differences in model structure, and in experimental data being referred to, yield extensive variation in parameter values (\mytab{tab:parvals}). The variation in $\rho$ is just a consequence of the different tumor growth models, which give a different meaning to the parameter in each model. Despite the differences, the values actually lead to comparable growth kinetics.
\linelabel{sentkilling:start}
 The biggest quantitative differences are in the killing kinetics. M2's killing rate $\xi$ is three orders of magnitude smaller than M1's, but M2 compensates for this by saturating the killing at a number of tumor cells that is five orders of magnitude higher than M1's. Overall, the amount of cells being killed when the immune system is active and the tumor exceeds the diagnosis threshold is comparable across the models.
\linelabel{sentkilling:end}

M3 was not explicitly parameterized by the authors \cite{Bekker2022}. Therefore, we set its parameters to the same values as in M1 or M2 as much as possible. For instance, because both M2 and M3 contain essentially unrestricted exponential growth of the tumor cells until M3 approaches the carrying capacity, we used the value for the tumor growth rate in M2 for M3. For the killing rate, we used a value that gave similar killing speed as M1 for tumors containing $10^{9}-10^{10}$ T~cells. Note that due to the saturation term in M1, the killing is faster in M3 for larger tumors and slower for smaller tumors. Two parameters, the T~cell exhaustion rate and the carrying capacity, were unique to M3. We set both to values that lead to a small influence of the corresponding terms on the simulation result and obtained comparable kinetics to the other two models at those parameter settings.

\subsection*{Simulating untreated disease, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in individual patients}

Using ODE models, we can implement different cancer immunotherapies in two general ways: (1) 
by changing model parameters; (2) by adding or removing cells at a certain time.

Using this ODE model, we simulated cancer development and disease trajectories in patients. We extensively
varied the tumor properties (i.e., the tumor growth rate, the growth rate decline, and the decline decay
rate) between patients to generate interpatient variation in disease courses. 


Each patient is simulated from cancer onset (i.e., malignant transformation of the first cell) for
up to ten years.
{\newbit \linelabel{parthresholds:start}
 As argued previously \cite{Creemers2021}, 
we start from a diagnosis threshold of a tumor mass of $65 * 10^8$ cells, corresponding to
the size at which common malignancies are diagnosed \linelabel{parthresholds:refs} \cite{Moreno2016,Zastrow2014,Ball2013}. The lethal tumor burden is set to $10^{12}$ tumor cells
(a tumor volume of approximately 10.6 dm$^3$). Since we expect both thresholds to vary considerably 
between patients, depending, for example, on the timing of doctor visits or a tumor's location, 
we implement them as random variables that change with every simulation. Specifically, every threshold is 
drawn from a log-normal distribution with a $4\sigma$ range of one order of magnitude. The upper $2\sigma$
point (95.45\% quantile) is set to  $65 * 10^8$ for diagnosis and  $10^{12}$ for death.
 \linelabel{parthresholds:end}
}

Disease trajectories of patients with cancer can be steered with therapy. 
{\newbit\linelabel{partreatmentsim:start}
In our model, treatment is implemented
by changing the model parameters once the tumor exceeds the diagnosis threshold, as we assume this is when
treatment starts. Given their prominent roles in many oncological treatment plans, we included immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and
chemotherapy in the models. Both treatments function through their primary modes of action. ICI are
implemented by increasing the killing rate of cytotoxic T cells (i.e., the parameter $\xi$) in M1 and M3.
In M2, it is implemented by increasing the T~cell activation rate $\alpha_A$ and decreasing the death rate $\delta$;
for simplicity, we restrict this such that the fold increase of $\alpha_A$ equals the fold decrease of $\delta$.
These changes are implemented directly after diagnosis and remain active for the rest of the simulation
unless stated otherwise.

}
The duration and potency of the ICI treatment (as measured by the magnitude of the
change of the affected parameters) eventually determine patient outcome.

In patients treated with chemotherapy, the immune system is still present; however, it is not
boosted (as is the case during ICI treatment). Hence, the T cells are not potent enough to curb tumor
growth. We implement the cytotoxic capacity of chemotherapy in the models uniformly
by reducing the tumor growth rate (parameter $\rho$) to a smaller number. Again, the duration and potency
(as measured by the reduction in tumor growth rate) determine patient outcome. By default, the treatment
duration for ICI and chemotherapy are two years and six months, respectively.

\subsection*{Simulations of patient cohorts and parameter fitting}

To generate heterogeneous patient populations, we draw each patient's growth rate
parameter $\rho$ from a log-normal distribution.
Depending on the parameter,
the simulated patient's tumor may clear spontaneously; such results are discarded 
(rejection sampling). When the tumor reaches the diagnosis threshold, we apply ICI, chemotherapy, 
a combination of chemotherapy and ICI, or we leave the patient untreated (i.e., a placebo treatment).
Therefore, each patient cohort (\myref{fig:fig2}{}) is characterized by two to four parameters:
mean and standard deviation of the log tumor growth rate, immunotherapy treatment effect
size, and chemotherapy treatment effect size. These two to four parameters can be fitted
to a given dataset. 

{\newbit
\linelabel{parfitabc:start}
Due to the stochastic nature of our model, we used an approximate Bayesian computation / sequential
Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) algorithm \cite{Sisson2007} to fit the parameters. 
As the test statistic for ABC-SMC, we used the root mean squared
difference (RMSD) between model-predicted and data-estimated survival curves 
(i.e., Kaplan-Meier curves) evaluated for each month in a 2-year time window 
upon diagnosis. We set the sample size for generating the model-predicted survival
curve to the same number of patients that is contained in the data being fitted.
\myref{fig:fig2}{} and \mysupp{fig:fits_m2_m3}{} show, for each model, the simulation 
that achieved the lowest RMSD to the target data during each ABC run.

We applied the ABC-SMC algorithm to all three patient cohorts shown in~\myref{fig:fig3}{}.
When examining the posterior distributions of the parameters, we found that a wide range of chemotherapy
effect values achieved comparable RMSD values for each model -- which is not surprising,
given that a higher baseline growth rate combined with a higher chemotherapy effect leads to similar
predicted tumor growth as a lower baseline growth rate combined with a lower chemotherapy effect.
We therefore performed a further set of fits to the CA184-024 data where we kept the chemotherapy effect
values fixed at 0.6 for M1 and M2 and at 0.75 for M3, respectively -- values that were chosen to obtain
comparable and realistic impacts of chemotherapy on the 2-year OS curves (\myref{fig:fig4}{A}), and were
plausible given the posterior distributions. We then again fitted the remaining three parameters to 
the CA184-024 data using ABC-SMC. By estimating the mode of the joint posterior distribution using
kernel density smoothing, we obtained the parameter values shown in Table~\ref{tab:parfits}.
\linelabel{parfitabc:end}

\subsection*{Simulating late-stage immunotherapy trials}
Late-stage (i.e., phase III) clinical trials traditionally contain two arms: a
control arm and a treatment arm. The control arm can be a placebo (i.e.,
untreated) or a standard of care therapy. To construct phase III \emph{in silico}
immunotherapy trials, we extended the simulations with treatment cohorts
(mono-chemotherapy, mono-immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or induction
chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy). These cohorts facilitate the
comparison between various treatment regimens. The treatment cohort uses the same
baseline distribution of tumor growth parameters as the control cohort. Upon reaching the diagnosis
threshold, up to two different treatments are applied in each arm; patients can be treated
with chemotherapy, ICI, combination therapy, or left untreated (as described above). 
Unless otherwise specified, the baseline distribution of tumor growth parameters was
derived from the most mature, digitized data from the CA184-024 trial, as shown below
\cite{Maio2015}. 

The primary endpoint of the trials is the 2-year OS. Given the absence of
accrual times in \emph{in silico} trials, the trial duration equals two years, providing 
each virtual patient with 24 months of follow-up at the time of analysis. 
If the OS endpoint is not reached for a patient (i.e., the patient's
tumor burden does not reach the lethal volume within the time frame of the
simulated trial), the patient is considered censored for the endpoint and regarded
as such in subsequent analyses.

\subsection*{Power and interim analysis simulations}
To illustrate how the analysis method can affect the outcome of immunotherapy
trials, we use several simulation approaches to calculate the power of trials.
Power simulations were performed as follows: a varying number of 
clinical trials were simulated per data point. The survival data from each trial was analyzed with a
log-rank test (dependent on the proportional hazard assumption) or proportions
test (Pearson's chi-squared test; independent of the proportional hazard
assumption), and we counted the number of positive trials (defined as $ p < 0.05 $).
The percentage of positive trials indicates the power of the trial. A harmful
trial is defined as a positive trial with an effect size that favours untreated
patients.

\subsection*{Data digitization \& reconstruction}
For some survival curves, the raw data was not available. Therefore, we
extracted data points from the Kaplan-Meier curves with WebPlotDigitizer 4.6
(\url{https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/}), and individual patient data was
reconstructed with the IPDfromKM package in R.
